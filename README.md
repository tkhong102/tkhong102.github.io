## Passion Project - HTML UI

In this lab, you will build your the passion project user interface in HTML & CSS. It should have the basic flow of your application.

For example, if you are building instagram, then I expect to see a page to see the pictures, a page to upload the pictures, and maybe an optional create account page.

## Example
